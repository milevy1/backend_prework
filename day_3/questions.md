## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
> A conditional statement checks if a statement is true or false and will run or skip the code based on that logic.
> 1. == : checks if two values are equal
> 2. !== : checks if two values are not equal
> 3. > : checks if a value is greater than the other

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
> If statements are used to make your code do different things depending on the result of a conditional if statement

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```Ruby

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
> To add multiple conditions, you can use the && or || operators or you could also nest multiple if statements within each other

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```Ruby

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
